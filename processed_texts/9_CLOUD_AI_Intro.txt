Machine learning - AWS
About this part of the course
Course goals
Data science: course in 2ITF
AI: course in 2ITF
Machine learning: focus of this course(AI on structured data, but we’ll be doing more than just that)
Deep learning and NLP: the rest of this course
Cloud
The cloud is important
This course uses an AWS-academy course
You’ll do about half of that course, joined with slides on the ‘regular’ canvas course
When studying:
Start from the Thomas More-slides
Do the AWS-course as by the planning on the next slide

The goal of using AWS is to get to know Sagemaker and S3 buckets
Cloud
Do the chapters on AWS after the lessons in class (before the next lesson)
Make sure you get a passing grade on the end-of-chapter-test
You can redo the test as often as you like
Planning:
Week 1: chapter 1 and 2
Week 2: chapter 3
Week 4: chapter 4
The other chapters are optional
The content is covered by the other teachers in this course
Course layout
6 half days:
Data science recap, AWS basic, AWS sagemaker
AWS and machine learning
MLOps (sagemaker, pipelines, ML Flow), AutoML and PyCaret
Time series and forecasting
Unsupervised learning
Project work
The project:
Do AI and advanced data science on an elaborate dataset
Do time series forecasting on another dataset (pass/fail and excelling)
Model preparation and hosting
The exam
Project deadline: Monday 24-nov-2025, midnight
Just after the Skil 3 project week. Don’t expect to have a lot of extra time during that week.
Friday after that: presentations (schedule TBD)
Present findings, open questions on the method used and the course material
Grading:
Project: 20% of final grade
Retained in August!
Other projects: 40% of final grade
Closed book exam: 40% of final grade
Of which 1/3 are machine learning-related questions

About the slides
The central guideline in this course
Refers to AWS-course or other external
Not numbered per class (week 1 is not necessarily ppt 1)
Not a good example for your final presentation
Your final presentation: sell yourself (or your project) to a jury
These presentations: course material, not selling anything
Don’t forget the notes, sometimes they contain more information or useful links
About the slides
Powerpoint is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, but it has its limits
Sometimes the slide will be a link
To a jupyter notebook with explanations
To a jupyter notebook with an exercise
To a markdown-file with explanations
To the module on AWS
…
The slides are the guide between all the other course material,but are not the only course material
What we’ll be doing
Modules on AWS
Contain course material and exercises
But the exercises are easy (just run the code, sometimes type some code)
Discussion topics
Basis for oral part of examination
Tries to get you to reflect on the course material (AWS and PPT)
To be discussed in your project-team (Study group!)
Exercises
To be done on Sagemaker or locally
Individual, but may be discussed in your project team
Not real “exercises,” more guidelines
Can generally be done in under 10 minutes, but shouldn’t
The project
Dataset 1: UK housing
Housing prices in the England/Wales between 1995 and 2017
Download from Kaggle
Dataset 2: UK Historic Electricity Demand Data
Electricity demand in England/Wales between 2001 and 2025
Download from Neso
Todo:
Data science: Clean and explore
Machine learning: Build models, compare them, build better models
Deploy: Create an interface to use your model

And the Lord spoke, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.”
