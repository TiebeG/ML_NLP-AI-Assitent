Introduction to machine learning

Understand the data: data science
This course directly follows data science in 2itf
You’ll need all the skills you picked up there:
Grabbing data
Importing data
Creating graphs
Getting information on data
All using Python and Pandas
Recap: Histogram and boxplot
p50
p75
p25
max
min
biggest non-outlier
smallest non-outlier
boxplot does not show the mean!
IQR
OUTLIERS
x > p75 + 1.5 * IQR
OUTLIERSx < p25 – 1.5 * IQR
1.5 * IQR
1.5 * IQR
IQRInter-Quartile Range
Recap: Mean and median
mean = average
median = “middle number”
mode = “most common value”
Recap: Exploratory data analysis
Variation
How much do values of a same variable change across observations.

		“1-D spread” – single spread

Covariation
How much do values of different variables change in a related way.

		“2-D spread” – related spread

Recap: Exploring variation
Categorical variable





Continuous variable

Histogram
Bar plot
Recap: Exploring covariation
Categorical/Continuous





Categorical/Categorical





Continuous/Continuous





Frequency polygonGrouped boxplot
Scatter plot2D histogram
Two-dimensional grid
Recap: Covariance and correlation
Correlation ≈ 1Strong positive relationship
Correlation ≈ 0
No relationship
Correlation ≈ -1
Strong negative relationship

Recap: Virtual Environments
Every project you do goes in its own personal virtual environment
Never in the main environment unless it uses no libraries
When using git (which you are) only upload requirements.txt, not the venv-folder

In your project:
One git repo, one requirements.txt (updated)
One venv per student
